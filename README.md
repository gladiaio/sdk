# Gladia SDK

This repository contains source code for the official Gladia SDK.

## Setup

This section will help you get started with the project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (latest [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#looking-for-the-latest-release-of-a-version-branch))

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```zsh
   npm ci
   ```

> [!TIP]
> All commands below assumes you do not have NX's CLI installed separately, hence the use of `npx nx …`.
> If you want, you can install it directly on your system following those [instructions](https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation).

2. **Verify the installation:**
   ```zsh
   npx nx --version
   ```
   This should show the version of NX.
